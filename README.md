Bulk-Create-Blogs
=================

A WordPress MU Plugin to allow the creation of blogs via CSV files.

This plugin is a fork of Greg Breese's work, updated by Ray Hoh to work with newer versions of WordPress.

The file should be installed in wp-content/mu-plugins folder. 

Although it is seemingly "network activated" the admin page exists under the Tools menu on the main domain, rather than within the Network Admin settings.

Bulk-Create-Blogs
=================

A WordPress MU Plugin to allow the creation of blogs via CSV files.

This plugin is a fork of Greg Breese's work, updated by Ray Hoh to work with newer versions of WordPress.

Installation: 

The gp-bulk-create-blogs.php file should be installed directly in the wp-content/mu-plugins folder. (http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins)

Use:

This plugin adds a Bulk Create Blogs menu in Network Admin, under Sites

This plugin does not create new users, so it's a perfect compliment in network setups that utilize an LDAP or SSO functionality to manage user creation. When used in tandem with a "Blog Request" Google/Gravity Form, this plugin allows the Network Admin to batch create sites for existing users, or batch add a group of users to an existing blog.
